# Eva Unit 01 x Catppuccin

## My windows Evangelion themed windows config. This is my first time ricing windows! I tried to use as little apps as possible and making everything as minimal as possible. 

# Programs

# Cursor
A simple [circle cursor](https://www.deviantart.com/idarques/art/Point-er-900139915), I think it fits better with the theme then a sharp cursor style.

# Wallpaper
I am very picky with wallpapers as I want them to look good for both single monitor and multi monitor use. I have 3 wallpaper options and some work well for multi but not all.
