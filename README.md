# Eva Unit 01 x Catppuccin

## My windows Evangelion themed windows config. This is my first time ricing windows! I tried to use as little apps as possible and making everything as minimal as possible. 

# Programs
- komorebi - windows tiling manager
- Windhawk - windows customization

# komorebi
I did change config path to my own for organization purposes. The config has some configuration with only 1 option for workspace layout. Please see komorebi documentation to add more layouts.

# Cursor
A simple circle cursor, I think it fits better with the theme then a more point cursor

# Wallpaper
As of now I only have 1 wallpaper available. I am very picky with wallpaper as it needs to look good for both single monitor and dual monitor (vertical) setups.

# Other
In terms of other programs I themed all with Catppuccin moca theme,
- Spotify
	- Spicetefy
- Discord
	- Vencord
- Firefox
	- Zen Browser
